    explanation: 'The problem states that 12 men can build a wall in 48 days. It also states that 18 boys can build the same wall in 48 days. We need to find how long 6 men or 9 boys will take. Consider the men: If 12 men take 48 days, then 6 men (which is half the number of men) will take twice the time to complete the same work, assuming their efficiency remains constant. Time for 6 men = 48 days × 2 = 96 days. Consider the boys: If 18 boys take 48 days, then 9 boys (which is half the number of boys) will also take twice the time. Time for 9 boys = 48 days × 2 = 96 days. Since both scenarios (6 men or 9 boys) yield the same result, the answer is 96 days.',

    options: ['10 per cent', '21 per cent', '20 per cent', '11 per cent'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Let the original radius of the circle be \'r\'. Original Circumference (C) = 2πr. Original Area (A) = πr². If the circumference is increased by 10%, the new circumference (C\') = C + 0.10C = 1.10C. Since C\' = 2πr\', we have 1.10(2πr) = 2πr\'. This implies r\' = 1.10r. The new radius is 1.10 times the original radius. Now, calculate the new area (A\') using the new radius r\': A\' = π(r\')² = π(1.10r)² = π(1.21r²) = 1.21(πr²). So, A\' = 1.21A. The increase in area is A\' - A = 1.21A - A = 0.21A. Percentage increase in area = (Increase in Area / Original Area) × 100 = (0.21A / A) × 100 = 0.21 × 100 = 21%.',

    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Let the initial quantity of milk be 7x litres and water be 2x litres. When 30 litres of water are added, the quantity of water becomes (2x+30). The new ratio is 7:5. (7x)/(2x+30) = 7/5. Cross-multiplying: 5(7x) = 7(2x+30) => 35x = 14x + 210 => 21x = 210 => x = 10. The initial quantity of milk is 7x = 7 × 10 = 70 litres.',

    correctAnswerIndex: 3,
    explanation: 'According to the problem, the work done by 6 men is equivalent to the work done by 8 women. This means 6 men = 8 women. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 3 men = 4 women. The new team consists of "3 men and 4 women." Since 3 men are equivalent to 4 women, the new team is essentially 4 women + 4 women = 8 women. The problem states that 8 women can do the work in 24 days. Therefore, the new team of 8 women will also take 24 days to complete the work.',

    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'The simple interest (SI) accrued in the time period between year 2 and year 5 is the difference between the amounts. SI for (5 - 2) = 3 years = 1,500 - 1,200 = Rs. 300. SI for 1 year = 300/3 = Rs. 100. The Principal (P) is the amount at year 2 minus the interest for 2 years. Principal = 1,200 - (100 × 2) = 1,200 - 200 = Rs. 1,000. Using the SI formula: SI = (P × R × T)/100 => 100 = (1000 × R × 1)/100 => 100 = 10R => R = 100/10 = 10%.',

    options: ['384 cubic units', '448 cubic units', '512 cubic units', '648 cubic units'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 3,
    explanation: 'Let the length be 2x, breadth be 3x, and height be 4x. The total surface area (TSA) of a cuboid is given by the formula 2(lb+bh+hl). 468 = 2((2x)(3x)+(3x)(4x)+(4x)(2x)) => 468 = 2(6x² + 12x² + 8x²) => 468 = 2(26x²) => 468 = 52x² => x² = 468/52 = 9 => x = 3. The dimensions are: Length = 2x = 6, Breadth = 3x = 9, Height = 4x = 12. Volume = l × b × h = 6 × 9 × 12 = 648 cubic units.',

    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'The current selling price is Rs. 80, which is 10% higher than the earlier selling price. Earlier selling price = 80/1.10 = 800/11. The earlier selling price provided a 20% profit on the original cost price (CP). Earlier selling price = CP × (1 + 20/100) = 1.20 × CP. 800/11 = 1.20 × CP => CP = 800 / (11 × 1.20) = 800 / 13.2 ≈ Rs. 60.61.',

  Question(
    questionText:'A sum of money amounts to ₹11898 in 2 years at compound interest. If the simple interest on it for 2 years is ₹880, what is the principal?',
    options:['₹10900', '₹11000', '₹10700', '₹9500'],
    correctAnswerIndex:1,
    explanation:'Simple interest for 2 years is ₹880, so the simple interest for one year is ₹440. The amount after 2 years is ₹11898. If we assume the principal is ₹11000 (option B), then the rate of simple interest would be R = (880 \\times 100) / (11000 \\times 2) = 4\\%. With this rate, the amount with compound interest would be P(1+R/100)^T = 11000(1+4/100)^2 = 11000(1.04)^2 = 11000(1.0816) = ₹11897.6, which is very close to ₹11898.',
