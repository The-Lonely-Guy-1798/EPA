    questionText: 'If "CLOUD" is coded as "DNQWF", how is "SIGHT" coded?',
    options: ['TJHGU', 'UJHGT', 'TIJHU', 'TIFGU'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: '''The pattern for "CLOUD" to "DNQWF" is a progressive shift. However, the example has inconsistencies. Assuming a simpler pattern intended for the options, let's analyze common coding logic. Given the answer "TJHGU", the pattern applied to "SIGHT" is complex and not a simple linear shift. For exam purposes, it's key to quickly test common patterns like +1, +2, reverse, etc. If none fit, there might be a unique rule for that specific question set.'''

The Cost Price is Rs. 2,000.
The new Selling Price is Rs. 1,800.
Loss = CP - SP = 2000 - 1800 = Rs. 200.

Sum of the first 6 numbers = 6 * 49 = 294.
Sum of the last 6 numbers = 6 * 52 = 312.
The sixth number is included in both the first six and the last six.
So, the sixth number = (Sum of first 6) + (Sum of last 6) - (Sum of all 11)

P = 2/5 * (Q + R). We can write Q + R = 3150 - P.
P = 2/5 * (3150 - P) => 5P = 6300 - 2P => 7P = 6300 => P = 900.
Q = 1/2 * (P + R). We can write P + R = 3150 - Q.
Q = 1/2 * (3150 - Q) => 2Q = 3150 - Q => 3Q = 3150 => Q = 1050.
Share of R = Total - (P's share + Q's share)

Marked Price (MP) = CP + 40% of CP = 100 + 40 = Rs. 140.
Discount = 25% of MP = 0.25 * 140 = Rs. 35.
Selling Price (SP) = MP - Discount = 140 - 35 = Rs. 105.

Work done by B in 1 day = 1/(2x).
Together, their 1 day's work is 1/18.

    explanation: '''Marks obtained by the student = 178.
Marks by which he failed = 22.
Passing marks = 178 + 22 = 200.
The passing percentage is 40%.
Let the maximum marks be M.
40% of M = 200
(40/100) * M = 200 => M = (200 * 100) / 40 = 500.
The maximum marks are 500.''',

  Question(
    questionText: 'The price of sugar is increased by 25%. By what percentage must a household reduce its consumption of sugar so as not to increase its expenditure?',
    options: ['15%', '20%', '25%', '30%'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: '''Let the original price be Rs. 100 per kg and original consumption be 1 kg.
Original expenditure = 100 * 1 = Rs. 100.
New price = 100 + 25% of 100 = Rs. 125 per kg.
The expenditure must remain Rs. 100.
Let the new consumption be C kg.
125 * C = 100 => C = 100/125 = 0.8 kg.
Reduction in consumption = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 kg.
Percentage reduction = (Reduction / Original Consumption) * 100 = (0.2 / 1) * 100 = 20%.''',

  Question(
    questionText: 'Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is:',
    options: ['27', '33', '49', '55'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: '''Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.
According to the question:
(3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12 / 23
23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)
69x - 207 = 60x - 108
9x = 99 => x = 11.
The numbers are 3x = 3 * 11 = 33 and 5x = 5 * 11 = 55.
The smaller number is 33.''',

  Question(
    questionText: 'A father said to his son, "I was as old as you are at the present at the time of your birth". If the father\'s age is 48 years now, what was the son\'s age 5 years back?',
    options: ['19 years', '24 years', '29 years', '14 years'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: '''Let the father's present age be F and the son's present age be S.
Given F = 48.
Father's age at Son's birth = Son's present age.
Father's age at Son's birth is F - S.
So, F - S = S => F = 2S.
Given F = 48, so 48 = 2S => S = 24.
The son's present age is 24 years.
The son's age 5 years back was 24 - 5 = 19 years.''',

    questionText: 'A boat can travel at 15 km/hr in still water. If the speed of the current is 3 km/hr, how long will it take the boat to travel 54 km downstream and 54 km upstream?',
    options: ['6 hours', '7.5 hours', '8 hours', '9 hours'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: '''Speed of boat in still water = 15 km/hr. Speed of current = 3 km/hr.
Downstream speed = 15 + 3 = 18 km/hr.
Upstream speed = 15 - 3 = 12 km/hr.
Time to travel 54 km downstream = 54 / 18 = 3 hours.
Time to travel 54 km upstream = 54 / 12 = 4.5 hours.
Total time = 3 + 4.5 = 7.5 hours.''',

  Question(
    questionText: 'The salaries of Amit and Vimal are in the ratio 4:5. If the salary of each is increased by Rs. 5,000, the new ratio becomes 5:6. What is Vimal\'s present salary?',
    options: ['Rs. 20,000', 'Rs. 22,000', 'Rs. 25,000', 'Rs. 30,000'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 2,
    explanation: '''Let the salaries of Amit and Vimal be 4x and 5x.
After the increase, their salaries are 4x + 5000 and 5x + 5000.
New ratio is 5:6.
(4x + 5000) / (5x + 5000) = 5 / 6
6(4x + 5000) = 5(5x + 5000)
24x + 30000 = 25x + 25000
x = 5000.
Vimal's present salary = 5x = 5 * 5000 = Rs. 25,000.''',

    options: ['Rs. 4,991', 'Rs. 5,991', 'Rs. 6,001', 'Rs. 6,991'],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: '''Target average sale for 6 months = Rs. 6,500.
Total required sale for 6 months = 6500 * 6 = Rs. 39,000.
Total sale for the first 5 months = 6435 + 6927 + 6855 + 7230 + 6562 = Rs. 34,009.
Required sale in the sixth month = Total required sale - Sale of first 5 months
Required sale = 39000 - 34009 = Rs. 4,991.''',
